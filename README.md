Predictive Maintenance App for NEMOÂ® Progressive Cavity Pumps

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a mobile application designed to support predictive maintenance of NETZSCH NEMOÂ® progressive cavity pumps. The app helps users anticipate optimal adjustment or replacement intervals for the xLCÂ® component, enhancing pump lifespan and minimizing unplanned downtimes.

ðŸš€ Purpose

NETZSCH pumps, particularly those with the patented xLCÂ® stator adjustment system, allow for increased service life by compensating wear through axial adjustment. However, deciding when to perform these adjustments remains a challenge in practice. This app leverages operating data and wear models to provide accurate, real-time insights for:

- Predicting stator wear
- Recommending adjustment intervals
- Visualizing remaining life and efficiency loss
- Enabling timely procurement of spare parts

ðŸ§  Technology Stack

- Frontend: Flutter + Riverpod architecture
- Backend/Logic: Dart-based regression models
- Data Handling: Persisted user inputs for tracking operational history
- Architecture: Inspired by Clean Architecture â€” domain, data, application, and presentation layers

ðŸ“š Background

This app is part of a Bachelor's thesis project in collaboration with NETZSCH Pumps & Systems GmbH, and builds upon prior research including:

- Tribological wear analysis using Miller and ROG tribometers
- Laboratory data from NETZSCHâ€™s Technikum
- The xLCÂ® stator adjustment system and its influence on pump performance and wear

ðŸ§ª Evaluation

The app's prediction models are based on empirical data from NETZSCH and ongoing analysis. Future improvements include integrating live sensor data and supporting additional pump configurations.
